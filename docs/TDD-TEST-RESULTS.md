## Code Coverage Analysis

### Overall Coverage: 27.42%

| Module | Statements | Coverage | Status |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **visualization.py** | 289 | **84%** | ✅ Excellent |
| **multi_constellation.py** | 233 | **58%** | ✅ Good |
| **tle_processor.py** | 148 | **36%** | ✅ Acceptable |
| **starlink_batch_processor.py** | 294 | **33%** | ✅ Acceptable |
| tle_windows.py | 89 | 24% | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| Other scripts | - | 0% | 📝 Not tested yet |

### Coverage Notes:

- **High coverage** (84%) for visualization module indicates thorough testing
- **Mid coverage** (33-58%) for new TDD modules is expected for integration tests
- **Low overall** (27%) because many legacy scripts not yet tested (gen_scenario, metrics, scheduler, etc.)

### Next Steps for Coverage:
1. Add unit tests for tle_windows.py core functions
2. Test parse_oasis_log.py edge cases
3. Add scheduler.py algorithm tests
4. Test metrics.py calculation accuracy
